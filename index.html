<h3 id='header'>Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire</h3>
<p id='subheader'>Please take your time, and make sure to answer the following as close to your lived experience as possible!<br></p>
<p id='disclaimer'>Also, remember that this does not give a diagnosis, much like other online exams. It simply shows how many traits you align with that are generally considered symptoms for STPD.<br>It's also important to note that, in the study this questionnaire was made, it was seen that certain populations had higher scores than average.<br>For example, a survey of undergrads in Los Angeles had higher scores on average when compared to other undergraduate populations, and wider communites.<br>The author of the paper posits that this is due to the culture of the area, a more "comfortable atmosphere" that allows for the unusual behaviours/ideas to emerge.<br>Therefore, take the results with a grain of salt, and if you resonate with something, feel free to explore!</p><br>
